# Manual for Employees App Service and UI

This project was created for a tech interview request.

The BE was created using .Net 8 and SQL Server.
The UI was created using React.

For time reasons I didn't include security or caching.

## Run the UI

See README on employee-ui folder.

## Run the Service

See README on employee-service folder.

## Light Web Version

You can open the app on https://santiagocano6.github.io/Employee-code-test/

This app will not use a DB but will mock BE calls
